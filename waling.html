                            aling looks like an ordinary municipality, not much different from any other mountain town
                            in Nepal. But it is poised for complete transformation, if the plans of its passionate mayor
                            are anything to go by.

                            Dilip Pratap Khand is a descendant of the royal family of this Syangja principality, one of
                            the last to fall to Prithvi Narayan Shah’s conquests in the mid-18th century. His
                            grandfather and father were both pro-democracy activists, and Khand won last year’s local
                            election by a comfortable margin.

                            The mayor is a graduate from Banaras Hindu University and exudes confidence, brimming with
                            ideas to turn his hometown into a Smart City, with the slogan, Wonderful Waling.

                            This is one of five municipalities of Syangja district, a two hour drive south of Pokhara
                            along the Siddhartha Highway. Situated amidst lush, rolling hills by the Andhi Khola Valley,
                            the land is fertile and famous for its rice. In fact, the name Waling is derived from a type
                            of folk song about rice plantation called ‘Wali’.

                            The central plank of Khand’s mayoral election campaign last year was the economic
                            transformation of the municipality. He claims he refrained from campaigning aggressively and
                            making lengthy speeches, preferring to portray himself as a doer rather than a talker.




                        <p>
                            “I briefly told people about my plans for Waling and urged them to exercise their discretion
                            and will,” Khand says.

                            He cultivated all-party support for his economic agenda, and seems to face fewer political
                            obstacles than his counterparts elsewhere. Immediately after his election, the Municipality
                            organised a workshop where it invited members of various political parties, winners and
                            runners-up of the local polls and town planning experts. They discussed smart city models in
                            India and other countries and formulated a 5-year strategy for Waling’s transformation.

                            The two main planks of the strategy focus on tourism and agro products in each village,
                            while the town will concentrate on planned urbanisation, waste management, transportation
                            and innovation centres. Khand expects both to generate up to 12,000 new jobs.

                            “We are already implementing a zero-waste policy and have made a profit of about Rs7 million
                            this year alone just by processing waste, and we have plans to recycle waste plastic for
                            road resurfacing,” he says.

                            Khand’s longer-term vision is to turn Waling into a technological, industrial and touristic
                            hub, and some of the work is already underway. Waling natives working as engineers in
                            Singapore and elsewhere have been convinced to come home to set up innovation labs in
                            schools so students can work on robotics and other gadgets to do chores like dishwashing and
                            cleaning.

                            The emphasis on hands-on education, Khand believes, will spur students’ creativity and
                            orient them towards technology and business. He plans a Waling industrial corridor to
                            produce cement and coal.

                            Khand is one of the few mayors who have not been criticised for buying expensive motors or
                            gadgets, often by imposing heavy taxes on local people. He follows Chanakya’s philosophy on
                            taxation: just like how a honeybee extracts just the right amount of honey from the flowers
                            so both survive and thrive, local governments should collect minimum taxes, and give them
                            back to the people.

                            Khand is distributing the taxes among local farmers and entrepreneurs as seed money to
                            produce fruits and vegetables. He is also planning to set up agro marts through which
                            Waling’s produces can be directly sold to markets in Pokhara, Butwal, Bhairawa and
                            Kathmandu, by eliminating middlemen.

                            Because transparency and efficiency are key to good governance, Khand wants to deliver,
                            through a mobile app, all 70 public services that the municipality is supposed to provide to
                            its residents. “We are collaborating with a mobile app developer, and will give people
                            tutorials on using the app. We will stop using paper application forms within a year,” he
                            says.

                            Asked whether or not he is biting more than he can chew, Khand’s reply is typical of the
                            man: “We are a full-fledged government with rights to formulate laws. We can accomplish a
                            lot if we have the will, the management skills and effective teamwork. Five years is a lot
                            of time in which to completely transform a place.”
